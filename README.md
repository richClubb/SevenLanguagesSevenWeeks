Exercises and code from the Book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce. A. Tate

# Intention

Mainly a storage for the exercises in the books chapters, for each language I'm going to try and write a Roman Numeral converter (e.g. to and from Roman Numerals) for each language to see if I can, and to try and use the special features / conventions for each language.

# Reviews

## Ruby

I'm not that much of a fan. The syntax is not particularly readable, and I can't see that many benefits over Python which I already know.

### Syntax

There are parts of the syntax I don't like, mainly the '' vs "" in the string manipulation. I understand it's benefits, but I think it would be a cause of great user confusion, especially in an interpreted language.

### Blocks

I quite like the iteration and blocks in Ruby, it's quite nicely self-contained and allows you to do a lot of operations on datasets fairly independently.

### Conclusion

I might play around with it a little more, but I think as I'm not a web programmer I doubt that I'll be using Rails any time soon and this is probably it's main stomping ground. For me it doesn't offer enough over Python, and I'm more familiar with it and it probably has better library support for what I tend to do.

## Io

## Prolog

## Scala

## Erlang

## Clojure

## Haskell

# Finishing Thoughts

While discussing this book a few points have already come up which I think are important to note.

## Why would you use a particular language?

While discussing Ruby we came up with the general idea of why would you pick up a particular language? And part of it comes from user comfort. If you've used it a lot then you might be happier with it and feel more comfortable working with it.

One example we had was Bash VS Python. Some people hated bash and tended to do everything in Python, but in cases when you can leverage the Linux command line utilities bash can be very powerful, and calling out to these programs from Python can be a little irritating. However personally when dealing with files and strings I'd rather do it in Python.

It's an odd question, and I think it needs a lot of constant questioning. What are the benefits? What is the critical threshold? When does performance trump readability and familiarity? It's easy to just say, "We're using this language!" but sometimes it really does benefit if parts of the program use a different language for good reason, even though this increases the overall complexity of the solution.

I think everyone who spends enough time programming realises that each language is a tool, and each tool is good for a certain purpose. And some languages are more flexible than others, but there comes a time when you need a torque-wrench and an adjustable spanner just doesn't work any more.
